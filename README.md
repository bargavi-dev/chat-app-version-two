    <h1>Kaburlu Chat App</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Kaburlu is a language exchange app in progress. It's inspired by the work of Literacy Advance and Literacy Connects, which are two non-profit organizations dedicated to giving free career resouces and English classes to refugees and recent immigrants. I am proud to have had the opprtunity to work with them and would love to present an app to the students from L. Advance and L. Connects to use among their classmates and beyond the classroom. The goal is for students to be able to private message different users in a "Friend's List", time their language exchange(to ensure equal speaking time for each language), and translate all on one platform.
      For those who are not familiar with language exchanges, here is a resource to learn more about them:

  <h2>Programming</h2>
  <p>This app was built using node.js and socket.io for the backend/creating the server and React-Native as the front-end framwork. Socket.io was used to create web-sockets that would allow for real-time chatting between users. A unique socket is associated with each user through a Redux action. Redux is also used to store and access state throughout the app. I used Expo in order to view and debug the app in both the browser view and the mobile simulator. </p>
